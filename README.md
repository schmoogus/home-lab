# home-lab
schmoogus' homelab!

in my homelab, it currently consists of dell hp elitedesk, running with 32gb of RAM, intel core i7-7700, 1 TB ssd, and 2x500gb HDDs.

nothing major at all, but upgrades will come in the future.

currently running on it :
- minecraft 1.21.5 server
- hosted by AMP on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- RDP access through anydesk, auto-startup script upon PC boot


plans for homelab :
- jellyfin or plex server to host my media
- firewall with pfSense
- cybersecurity pentesting lab (kali vm, win 10 vm, pfSense for firewall)
- NAS server

my goal of my homelab is to not only gain experience for my career, but to also host things that i frequently use all by myself, for complete control over what i can do with it all.
